Please note well that the predictions are sorted by who was predicted with the most vote by our model. The share and prediction do not add up to 1.000 when adding every entries. For example one player can have a total share of 0.75 and another one can have 0.62. Highest share possible for one player is 1.000. We are using a regression, sometimes the prediction can be higher than 1.000.
